    "Functions of the Operating System: Resource Management: The operating system manages and allocates memory, CPU time, and other hardware resources among the various programs and processes running on the computer. \n",
    "Process Management: The operating system is responsible for starting, stopping, and managing processes and programs. It also controls the scheduling of processes and allocates resources to them. \n",
    "Memory Management: The operating system manages the computer's primary memory and provides mechanisms for optimizing memory usage. \n",
    "Security: The operating system provides a secure environment for the user, applications, and data by implementing security policies and mechanisms such as access controls and encryption. \n",
    "Job Accounting: It keeps track of time and resources used by various jobs or users. \n",
    "File Management: The operating system is responsible for organizing and managing the file system, including the creation, deletion, and manipulation of files and directories. \n",
